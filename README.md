# MindCare: An AI-driven Chatbot for Emotional Assistance

MindCare is an AI-driven chatbot designed to provide emotional assistance through natural language conversations. By leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models and fine-tuning techniques, MindCare is equipped to offer empathetic and supportive responses to individuals seeking mental health counseling. This project is centered on creating a meaningful dialogue experience that can be a valuable tool in mental health support.

## Features

- **Advanced NLP Models**: Built using the T5 transformer model, fine-tuned to generate contextually relevant and emotionally intelligent responses.
- **Custom Dataset**: Trained on a specialized dataset containing mental health counseling conversations, ensuring that the chatbot understands and responds with empathy.
- **LoRA Fine-Tuning**: Employs Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently fine-tune the model, making it adaptable to specific emotional contexts.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessed using BLEU scores to ensure high-quality, accurate, and contextually appropriate responses.
- **Scalable Training**: Utilizes Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) strategy for efficient training on large datasets, enhancing the model's scalability.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To set up MindCare, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. This will prepare your environment to run the training, evaluation, and inference scripts.

### Usage

- **Training**: Train the model on your custom dataset to adapt it to specific counseling scenarios.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model’s performance using BLEU scores and other relevant metrics to ensure the chatbot meets the desired quality standards.
- **Inference**: Test the chatbot by providing prompts and observing the generated responses to assess its ability to engage in meaningful conversations.

### Dataset

MindCare is trained on a custom dataset designed to reflect real-world mental health counseling conversations. The dataset has been carefully curated and preprocessed to ensure that the chatbot can understand and respond to a wide range of emotional cues.

### Model Architecture

The core of MindCare is based on the T5 model architecture, which has been fine-tuned using the LoRA technique. This combination allows the chatbot to generate empathetic responses efficiently. The training process is optimized using the FSDP strategy, making the model both robust and scalable.

## Results

The MindCare model achieves high BLEU scores on evaluation datasets, indicating strong performance in generating relevant and empathetic responses. Through rigorous testing, the chatbot has demonstrated its ability to handle various emotional scenarios, providing valuable support to users.
